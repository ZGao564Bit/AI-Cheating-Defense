## About our program
Machine learning can do a lot kind of work. Recently in the vedio game community, there is a kind of cheating programs use machine learning. Because they are different than the traditional gameing cheating programs, they are hard for game companies to detect and prevent. The goal of our program is developing a method to defend this kind of programs. 

There are two of main tasks in our project: 
1. Developing a ML based cheating software: 
2. Finding a method to defend.  


## Operation Steps for our program:
1. run "keyboardlistener.py"
2. run "detect.py"
3. open the picture/video/game
4. click on "ctrl+shift+alt", the analysis will begin
5. click on "ctrl+alt+z", the analysis will stop.

## Methods to defend using Adversarial Examples: 
1. Used to condidence value to find the places and colors which will have best effects to confuse the machine learning program. 
2. Used to fast gradient sign method to add adversarial examples to the game images.
